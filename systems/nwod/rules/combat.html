                        <p>Combat involves a single dice pool roll per attack.
                            The result determines whether or not your character hits
                            and how much damage he inflicts on his target. The dice
                            pool is determined as above, but the equipment modifier
                            depends on the weapon used. A knife is more deadly than
                            a fist, and a gun is more deadly than all.<br><br>Each success gained on your attack roll represents a
                            point of damage inflicted against the target&#x27;s Health trait.
                            When the target has no more Health left, he is unconscious
                            or dead (depending on the type of damage done).<br><br>
                            There are three types of damage: bashing (caused by
                            blunt weapons such as fists or clubs; these wounds heal
                            quickly), lethal (caused by sharp weapons such as knives
                            and bullets; these wounds heal slowly) and aggravated
                            (caused by devastating supernatural attacks; these wounds
                            take a very long time to heal).<br><br>
                            There are a number of complications involved in combat,
                            such as a target&#x27;s Defense trait (which is subtracted
                            from any melee attack dice pools targeted against him),
                            penalties for armor, for hiding behind cover, and more.
                            Details are described in the following chapters, but the
                            basics are simple. Roll to hit and apply successes as damage.</p>
