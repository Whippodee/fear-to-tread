                            <h2>Rolling the Dice</h2>
                        </header>
                        <p>Each die that rolls a result of 8, 9 or 10 is considered
                            a success. You might have more than one of these,
                            in which case you have multiple successes. Storytelling
                            doesn&#x27;t just tell you whether your character succeeds or
                            fails — it shows you how well he does.<br><br>If none of your dice roll any of these numbers, your
                            roll fails. This is rarely fatal. It&#x27;s most often simply a setback,
                            and your character can usually try the action again
                            (or again and again in the case of combat).<br><br>Obviously, the more dice you have in your dice pool,
                            the better your character&#x27;s chances of success, and the
                            greater your odds of gaining multiple successes.<br><br>In addition, there is a special rule called “10 Again.”
                            Whenever you roll a 10 on any die, you may roll that die
                            again. If that die rolls 8, 9 or 10, you&#x27;ve got another success.
                            In fact, if it rolls 10 once again, you can keep rolling
                            as long as you keep getting 10&#x27;s, accumulating more and
                            more successes along the way. So, if you rolled three dice
                            for a result of 2, 8 and 10, you&#x27;d have two successes. That
                            10 is re-rolled, however. If it turns up an 8 or 9, that&#x27;s a
                            third success and the re-rolls stop. In the case of another
                            10, that&#x27;s a third success and the die is rolled again until
                            no more 10&#x27;s result.</p>
