                        <p>An instant action is resolved with a single dice roll.
                            Only one success is required to complete an instant action,
                            although extra successes might improve the results.
                            Instant actions include anything that can be accomplished
                            in the span of three seconds: throwing a punch, jumping
                            a fence, sneaking past a security guard.<br><br>
                            An extended action is resolved with a series of dice
                            rolls, and your successes in each roll are tallied, working
                            to collect the total needed to complete the task. The Storyteller
                            usually determines the total number of successes
                            needed (guidelines are provided in the following chapters).
                            Each roll takes a certain amount of time within the
                            story, from five minutes to a whole day, depending on the
                            task. The Storyteller declares how long it takes to complete
                            one die roll, during which time your character acts
                            to accomplish the task. For example, fixing a car takes
                            about 30 minutes per roll. A simple tune-up might require
                            only four successes, while a transmission rebuild
                            might require 10 or more.<br><br>A third kind of action is called a contested action. It
                            can happen quickly in the space of time of an instant action,
                            or over a prolonged period as an extended action. In
                            a contested action, two or more opposing characters seek
                            to accomplish a feat first or better than the others. He
                            who gets the most successes (or the required total first in
                            the case of an extended task) is the winner. Arm wrestling
                            is an instant, contested action. Two characters competing
                            to be first to win a long-distance race is an extended,
                            contested action.</p>
