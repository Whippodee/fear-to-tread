                    <article>
                        <header>
                            <h2>
                                1. Background

                        </header>
                        <p>First, create your character&#x27;s
                            concept. To help get a handle on your character&#x27;s identity
                            and motivations, come up with a short, two- or three-word
                            description of him/her. This usually, but not always,
                            includes some idea of a career: “nightstalking journalist,”
                            “stoic mechanic,” “lost waif,” “petulant yuppie,” “angry
                            young man.”<br><br>
                            Second, choose your character&#x27;s faction. If you&#x27;re playing
                            a mortal, this is relatively unimportant. He could be a
                            cop, a private investigator or a convenience-store clerk,
                            but he is not defined by his factional alliances. A supernatural
                            being, however, is drawn into a world of ancient
                            legacies in which he is judged by even his involuntary
                            affiliations. His faction is both his strength and his curse.
                            For details on supernatural factions, see <strong>Vampire: The
                            Requiem</strong>, <strong>Werewolf: The Forsaken</strong> or <strong>Mage: The Awakening</strong>.<br><br>
                            <strong>Option:</strong> Preludes. An intense Storytelling method is
                            to roleplay mortal characters before they become initiated
                            into the supernatural world. That way, their introduction
                            to the terrible truths hiding in the shadows has more meaning
                            and can be especially traumatic, tragic or even triumphant.
                            If you&#x27;re creating a prelude character, wait to choose
                            his faction based on how gameplay events transform him.</p>
